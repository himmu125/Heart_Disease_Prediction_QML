# Heart Disease Prediction

Project on Spam mail detection using Quantum Machine Learning. Implemented on Google Colab notebook in Python language.

In this Quantum Machine Learning project I have trained the ML model using structed and well labeled data. Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) algorithm was used to build the predicition model and the accuracy of this model is 90%.

Description of the code :- Libraries of python used in this project : sklearn, pandas, torch, numpy and pennylane.

Installing Pennylane software framework to use features of quantum machine learning (qml)
Importing Libraries
Splitting dataset into traning and testing dataset
Initializing Quantum circuit
Creation of Quantum Kernel
Predicition Model Training (QSVM)
Evaluation of Tranined Model
Measuring Accuracy
Thank you
